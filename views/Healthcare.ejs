        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>I make this project, because i have a potential vision for healthcare in the blockchain field. Users will 
            own their data, protect their data with their hot wallet or cold wallet. Users can also share their data to their
            doctors such as health status, insurance ID, insurance date, phone number whenever they visit hospital or just walk in clinic. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Information About The Project</h2>
        <p>Blockchain has the transparent feature for users, but it also has the high security feature. This mean everyone can see your wallet's activity, but noone can not track your data information such as your
            healthcare data. But this feature is used when the smart contract is created to aim this purpose. With my project, you can experience the web 3.0 with healthcare digital wallet. Click the Medium button to read more about this project.
